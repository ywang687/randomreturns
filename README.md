Based on a paper by Peter L Brandt, this shiny app allows you to see how factors like win rate, bet size, and payout ratio does not necessarily guarantee trading success. In fact, randomness can have a huge factor on trading outcomes (this may seem obvious, but please read on), in both the short term and the long term. Having a lot of discipline and good research is, therefore, no guarantee of success. What could this imply for the average investor? If you are struggling to turn a profit, it may or may not be due wholly to your strategy. What this tells me is that a lot of proper backtesting is required along with live results to determine a profitable trading strategy. This may, of course, already be obvious to many who are already ardent backtesters, but it might still be interesting to see just how varied results can be with a single strategy.
